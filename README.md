# Akbari_Leila_Portfolio

This website is designed as a portfolio where I introduce myself and tell about my interests and add my selected portfolios. By clicking on each project, its details and the process that has been completed will be displayed. Companies and individuals can communicate with me by placing communication channels including my email and social media accounts.
